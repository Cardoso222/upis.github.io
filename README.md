### Use

You will need use our markup style but it's so easy... Well... you will use "- " for issue title, "> " for issue description and "# " for issue labels (multiple labels will be separated by comma). Eg:

```
- As user i want to login on system
> The user will login with email and password
# user,essential
- As user i want to edit my profile
> The user will upload profile picture and update personal data
# user,essential,file
```

This input will generate two issues:
- As user i want to login on system
  - The user will login with email and password (description)
  - #user #essential (labels)
- As user i want to edit my profile
  - The user will upload profile picture and update personal data (description)
  - #user #essential #file (labels)

### The space after the character (-, # or >) is fundamental!! Don't forget!

We do not store any of your data! If you want, check the code.
