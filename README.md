# Submit multiple issues to your GitLab or GitHub project
You will need use our markup style but it's so easy... Well... you will use "- " for issue title, "> " for issue description and "# " for issue labels (multiple labels will be separated by comma). Eg:

``` text
- As user i want to login on system
> The user will login with email and password
# user,essential
```

``` note
The space after the character (-, # or >) is fundamental!! Don't forget!
```

``` note
We do not store any of your data! If you want, check the code.
```
